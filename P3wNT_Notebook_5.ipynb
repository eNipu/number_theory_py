The more interesting aspects -- from the standpoint of programming and number theory -- arise in **algorithms** related to modular arithmetic.  Here we focus on Pingala's algorithm, a method for computing exponents based on an ancient method for enumerating poetic meters.  We analyze the **expected performance** of this algorithm using Python's `timeit` function for timing and `randint` function to randomize input parameters.  We also see how the performance depends on the number of **bits** of the input parameters.  In this way, we gently introduce some practical and theoretical issues in computer science.\n",

In this sense \"mod 5\" (standing for \"modulo 5\") is a [prepositional phrase](https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/08/grammar), describing the \"modular world\" in which 23 is the same as (\"congruent to\") 3.\n",

Thus, if you keep on asking witnesses at random, your chances of detecting non-primality increase exponentially!  In fact, the witness 2 suffices to check whether any number is prime or not up to 2047.  In other words, if $p < 2047$, then $p$ is prime if and only if `Miller_Rabin(p,2)` is `True`.  Just using the witnesses 2 and 3 suffice to check primality for numbers up to a million (1373653, to be precise, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).)\n",
